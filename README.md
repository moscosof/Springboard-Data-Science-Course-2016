Prudential Life Insurance assessment: Can you make buying life insurance easier? (Kaggle Competitions)

**Background:**  The on-line life insurance application process is antiquated. Customers provide extensive information to identify risk classification and eligibility, including scheduling medical exams, a process that takes an average of 30 days.

**The Aim:** Develop a predictive model that accurately classifies risk using a more automated approach.  The results will help Prudential understand the predictive power of the data points in the existing assessment, enabling us to significantly streamline the process.

**Data:**                                                                                                                                    
train.cvs: Conntains the response values.                                                                                                   
test.csv: The test set, you must predict the Response variable for all rows in this file.                                                     
sample_submission.csv: a sample submission file in the correct format.

In this dataset, you are provided over a hundred variables describing attributes of life insurance applicants.
The task is to predict the "Response" variable for each Id in the test set. "Response" is an ordinal measure of risk that has 8 levels.
